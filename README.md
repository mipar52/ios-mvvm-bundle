# iOS MVVM bundle

A collection of mini iOS projects to practice the MVVM desing pattern, but also to additionally practice making 'simple' bindings between Views and ViewModels and vice versa.
Also practiced using the SnapKit framework for easier auto-layout implementation.

## Weather-MVVM
A simple application that uses the OpenWeather API to fetch information about the weather. Enter
the city you're interested in and you'll get the current weather, along with the minimal and
maximal weather in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

## Orders-MVVM
An application that simulates a coffee shop, where you read the coffee orders, but also add orders
which are first being sent to the server and later reloaded in the application (used
warp-wiry-rugby to send requests).

## News-MVVM
Yet another simple application to fetch News articles.

## MVVM-binding-pratice
A login screen to enter the login data, but also to fetch login data from the 'dummy server' (no
real servers were used). View to ViewModel/ViewModel to View 'simple' bindings through closures
were practiced here.
